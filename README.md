  Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational implementation of a console-based student management system using core Java concepts and Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
It demonstrates clean code structure, modular design, and practical application of the Collections Framework. The system can be expanded further with additional features 
such as data persistence, enhanced search capabilities, sorting, or a graphical interface. This project reflects a solid understanding of Java fundamentals and provides a 
strong base for building more advanced backend applications.
